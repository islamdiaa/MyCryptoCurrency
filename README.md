## My implementation for Blockchain and Cryptocurrency from Scratch

The blockchain is a revolutionary technology that allows for the secure, distributed, decentralized storage of information. Over the past few years, the blockchain has taken the engineering landscape by storm. Many people in the industry predict that the blockchain will disrupt the ways we interact with technology on the same way the Internet did in the early 2000s.

## Highlights
- A Blockchain in the object-oriented programming style in NodeJS.
- Generate hashes for blocks in the chain.
- Unit Test Components of the Blockchain.
- Create an API around the Blockchain.
- Create a real-time connected peer-to-peer server.
- Implement a proof-of-work algorithm.
- Sign Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.
- Create a Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.
- Include transactions in core blocks of the chain.

## Run instructions
- npm run test: To run the test suite
- npm run dev: To run the server on the dev mode
- npm run start: Start the server
- HTTP_PORT=<X> P2P_PORT=<Y> PEERS=ws://localhost:<Z> npm run dev: Run the server on http port X and p2p connection port Y and connect with peer running on port Z
- npm run flow:check: To run flow checks
- npm run flow:build: To transpile flow to js
